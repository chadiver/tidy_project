tidy_project
============

Class project for Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data class

run_analysis.R is a script that transforms the raw data into two tidy data sets, Means and Summary.
run_analysis.R assumes that the .zip file has already been zipped and that the present working directory contains the folder "UCI HAR Dataset"

If you prefer to start at an earlier stage, download.R contains the script that downloads the file from the website and unzips it into the current working directory.

More detailed information on the data provided in Means.csv and Summary.csv is provided in CodeBook.md
